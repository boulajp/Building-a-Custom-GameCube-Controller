# Building a Custom GameCube Controller: A Journey of Learning and Mistakes

## Introduction

Welcome to my journey of building a custom GameCube controller for my friend, Michael, as a going-away present. This controller is inspired by the late rapper Lil Peep, featuring artwork based on his tattoos. In this blog post, I will share the process, mistakes, and lessons learned along the way. I'll also provide images to help illustrate my progress at each step.

## Part 1: Controller Artwork

### 1.1 Removing the Nintendo Logo

To give the controller a cleaner look, I removed the Nintendo logo from the white controller shell using a magic eraser before applying any decals.

### 1.2 Choosing Tattoos and their Positioning

The first step was to select a set of Lil Peep's tattoos to incorporate into the controller's design. I carefully picked tattoos that would not only look great on the controller but also represent his unique style.

### 1.3 Preparing the Decals

To create the decals, I cropped the images using Paint.NET. Next, I used imgupscaler.com to upscale the images and vectorizer.io to vectorize them, ensuring high-quality printable decals.

### 1.4 Printing, Sealing, and Applying Decals

I printed the decals onto waterslide decal paper and sealed them with a clear coat paint. This step is crucial to protect the decals from damage.

When applying the decals, I cut each one out, submerged it in water, applied microset onto the controller, positioned the decal, dried it with a rag, and applied microsol.

### 1.5 Clear Coat Application and Safety Precautions

After applying the decals, I used a 2K automotive clear coat to seal and protect them. 2K paint is a two-component paint that, when mixed, creates a durable and high-gloss finish. 2K clear paint was necessary to provide a smooth enough finish for comfortable use and to protect against degradation from oily hands. Unfortunately, 2K paint is also highly toxic, so I took precautions by wearing a respirator, goggles, and a paint suit during the painting process.

### 1.6 Decal Sanding and Finishing

Once the clear coat had cured, I sanded the decals with ~3000 grit sandpaper to level the surface and hide the decal borders. To restore the finish after sanding, I used scratch remover and plastic polish.

### 1.7 Mistakes and Lessons Learned

During the artwork process, I encountered a few challenges. Initially, I tried using a Cricut machine to cut the decals after printing them onto waterslide decal paper. However, the cuts were messy, and I decided to cut them by hand instead.

By documenting and learning from my mistakes, I was able to create a stunning custom controller design.

## Part 2: Custom Picture Buttons

### 2.1 Designing and Ordering Picture Buttons

To further customize the controller, I designed and ordered buttons that featured Lil Peep's tattoos. I ordered these unique picture buttons from "No Jons Mods," as they specialize in creating picture buttons for controllers.

### 2.2 Installing the Picture Buttons

Once the picture buttons arrived, I carefully installed them into the controller, making sure they fit and functioned properly.

### 2.3 Mistakes and Lessons Learned

Thankfully, I encountered no significant issues during the picture button design and installation process. This success highlights the importance of working with skilled vendors and planning the design carefully.

## Part 3: PHOB Motherboard Installation

### 3.1 Harvesting Parts from a Donor Controller

To build this custom controller, I used my JP White GameCube controller as a donor. The process involved disassembling the donor controller and harvesting the necessary components described in the next section.

### 3.1 Soldering Components

I swapped the original motherboard for a PHOB motherboard, which incorporates hall-effect sensor sticks. This required soldering components such as the controller cable, trigger potentiometers, trigger paddles, and the C stick ribbon cable.

### 3.3 Cleaning and Lubricating Stickboxes

To ensure smooth operation, I cleaned the stickboxes once with isopropyl alcohol and applied keyboard switch lubricant instead of stickbox grease.

### 3.2 Installing Magnets and Attaching Stickboxes to the PHOB Motherboard

To prepare the stickboxes for the PHOB motherboard, I began by gluing the magnets to their 3D printed nylon magnet holders using Loctite super glue. Then, I used the same glue to attach the magnets and holders to the sides of the stickboxes. Once the glue had set, I secured the stickboxes to the PHOB motherboard.

### 3.4 Mistakes and Lessons Learned

Initially, I encountered an issue when trying to close the controller. I needed to trim down the button pads more than advised to ensure a proper fit. Through this challenge, I learned the importance of adjusting to the unique requirements of custom parts.

## Part 4: Quality of Life Improvements

### 4.1 Torx Screw Replacement

To make future reassembly easier, I replaced all screws on the controller (shell, trigger bracket, stickbox) with torx screws.

### 4.2 Trigger Upgrades

During the trigger upgrades, I experimented with various combinations of different length trigger plugs, different numbers of o-rings, and different amounts of silicone tape to achieve the right feel. After several attempts, I finally found the optimal setup for both triggers.

Both triggers received aftermarket "Rienne" springs and low friction silicone tape to increase smoothness. The left trigger was given a long trigger plug and set to digital-only mode to serve as a powershield button, while the right trigger remained a general-purpose (analog + digital) trigger.

### 4.3 Stickbox Spring Replacement

I disassembled both stickboxes, cleaned them, and replaced their springs with fresh springs from new OEM type 3 stickboxes for smoother operation.

### 4.4 Out of Scope Considerations

I considered adding shell notches and a paracorded cable to the custom controller but decided against them. Shell notches can be challenging to create with a professional feel, and I didn't want to risk damaging the only white shell I had. Additionally, aftermarket cables have a higher failure rate than OEM cables, which led me to decide against a paracorded cable.

## Conclusion

Throughout this journey, I've learned that building a custom GameCube controller is a challenging but rewarding process. By learning from my mistakes and sharing my experiences, I hope this blog post can help others who embark on a similar journey. I'm thrilled with how the final product turned out, and I'm sure Michael will love his one-of-a-kind Lil Peep-inspired controller.
